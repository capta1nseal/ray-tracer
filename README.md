# ray tracer

I (capta1nseal) watched Sebastian Lague's video on optimising a ray traced renderer using BVH traversal, and thought it would be a good time to make my own raytracer.
A certain scene with a cube-shaped room and mirrored walls got me thinking about how cool it would be to implement (visual) portals with a ray-traced renderer.
It follow that the priorities of this project are:
- implement a ray-traced renderer
- optimise the renderer with BVH traversal
- portals!
